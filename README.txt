# Make commands:
To build the program: make build
To clean the binaries: make clean

# Program arguments:
-p : Port number for TCP socket. UPD socket listens to the next port
-h : hostfile
-pause : Seconds to sleep upon starting

# Pass following flags to leader process to simulate test cases 2 and 4
-t4 : Executes logic for testcase 4
-t2 : Executes logic for testcase 2. Will not remove failed node


Note: Only first 3 test cases will work
I haven't submitted automated test cases yet, have to do it manually.
